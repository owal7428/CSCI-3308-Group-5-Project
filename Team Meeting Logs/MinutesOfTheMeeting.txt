Group Meeting (30 minutes): November 10th, 2022
Discussed feedback from TA and next week's plans. We went over the project board and reviewed our user requirements. Then, we designated roles for individual tasks, with this as each person's role:
Zane: Working on calender, can help with search frontend.
Vincent: City -> Latitude and Longitude API
Neil: Flight API. 
Ethan: Databases. Can help with homepage and search.
Kyle: Weather API. Can help with frontend, connecting to backend.

Notes from Group meeting:
Try to keep things seperate from home page for now, i.e. search results
Focus on functioning backend, try not to worry about ascetics for now
Weather API gives us single data point, not map, so keep in mind for SQL database
Use request format function from Kyle for API requests
