Group Meeting (30 minutes): November 10th, 2022

Discussed feedback from TA and next week's plans. We went over the project board and reviewed our user requirements. Then, we designated roles for individual tasks, with this as each person's role:

* Zane: Working on calender, can help with search frontend.
* Vincent: City -> Latitude and Longitude API
* Neil: Flight API. 
* Ethan: Databases. Can help with homepage and search.
* Kyle: Weather API. Can help with frontend, connecting to backend.

Notes from Group meeting:

* Try to keep things seperate from home page for now, i.e. search results
* Focus on functioning backend, try not to worry about ascetics for now
* Weather API gives us single data point, not map, so keep in mind for SQL database
* Use request format function from Kyle for API requests

Third TA Meeting (15 minutes): November 17th, 2022

* We presented our progress for the week, including the landing page, the search feature, better login capability, further calender progress, more database capability, and error handling.
* We asked questions on how to share our private api keys between each other:
We can either each make individual accounts, or share keys privately between ourselves, and both solutions work.
* We presented our documentation, including meeting notes, future plans, and release notes, and verified that we are doing it in the correct format.
* For the following week, we plan on polishing the frontend to improve the user experience, completing the search results page, calender, and allow the user to save their trips to their account.
* See release notes and future plans documentation for more details.
