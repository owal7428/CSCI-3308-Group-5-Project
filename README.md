Application Description:
A wesbite allowing a curated selection of flights/travel related items based on preferences inputed by user. It will allow a large selection of criteria based on a variety of databases, along with a smooth and intuitive user experience. We will take advantage for a few API's to give users access to large range of information tailored to their wants and need for the traveling experience. Our users will be able to create an account, login, and access their plans in an organized and flexible way.

After a user saves a travel itinerary, they will be able to view their plans in the form of a calendar and make edits to the plan as they deem fit. They will also be able to view individual travel plans at a glance on a sidebar to sort through various plans that they have. Users and the itineraries that they build will be stored in a database so it can be accessed whenever they log in. Data that can be viewed about each itinerary will include price, destination, and other filters based on the connected APIs.

Vision Statement: 
For adventurers, who want to broaden their horizons with their own tailored experience. Airfare Affairs is a travel manager that provides personalized search and booking capabilities based on preferences. Unlike booking.com, our product creates a full itinerary based on multiple filters, such as: location, weather, and price. 


Communication Plan:
We plan on communicating through mainly Discord and I-message, but we may also use Zoom or Google Calendar to schedule and complete meetings.

TA Weekly Meeting Time:
