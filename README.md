Application Description:
A wesbite allowing a curated selection of flights/travel related items based on preferences inputed by user. It will allow a large selection of criteria based on a variety of databases, along with a smooth and intuitive user experience. We will take advantage for a few API's to give users access to large range of information tailored to their wants and need for the traveling experience. Our users will be able to create an account, login, and access their plans in an organized and flexible way.

After a user saves a travel itinerary, they will be able to view their plans in the form of a calendar and make edits to the plan as they deem fit. Users and the itineraries that they build will be stored in a database so it can be accessed whenever they log in. Data that can be viewed about each itinerary will include weather, destination, and other filters based on the connected APIs.

Technology Stack:
This project was completed using a combination of the following frameworks: JavaScript, CSS, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, HTML, EJS, and expressJS.

Vision Statement: 
For adventurers, who want to broaden their horizons with their own tailored experience. Airfare Affairs is a travel manager that provides personalized search and booking capabilities based on preferences. Unlike booking.com, our product creates a full itinerary based on multiple filters, such as: location, weather, and price. 

No prerequisite software is needed to run this website, unless running locally in which case Docker is recommended.

How to Run Website Locally:
In order to run the website locally, 4 API keys are needed, one from airlabs for their Flight API, instructions can be found in detail for this on pull request INSERT HERE, Meteomatics for their weather API, instructions for this can be found on pull request #37, and 2 API Ninja API's for City to coordinates and city to IATA code, both instructions can be found in pull request #56.


Communication Plan:
We plan on communicating through mainly Discord and I-message, but we may also use Zoom or Google Calendar to schedule and complete meetings.

TA Weekly Meeting Time:
Thursdays 3:30 pm
